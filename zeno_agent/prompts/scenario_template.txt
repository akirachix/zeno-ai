Let's walk through this scenario together:

Commodity: {commodity} Country: {country} Shock: {shock_type} by {percentage}% Timeframe: Next {months} months

Step 1: Fetching historical data
-I retrieved the most recent {months} months of price data for {commodity} in {country}:
{base_prices}

Step 2: Applying the scenario shock
-I simulated a {shock_type} of {percentage}%. Here are the projected prices:
{scenario_prices}

Step 3: Visualizing the impact
-I generated a chart comparing the historical trend with the scenario projection.

Step 4: Interpreting the results

-The baseline trend indicates recent market behavior.
-The scenario line shows how a {shock_type} by {percentage}% could affect prices.
-[You may briefly explain the direction here, e.g., "An increase in price may reduce demand."]
